# AsmInterp

An interpreter for assembly-like code.

This program was mostly written thanks to ChatGPT. As an outcome, it was stunningly surprising how fast and reliable chatGPT can be for creating code based on simple prompts. Though it requires of course a strong knowledge of programming, but what if a beginner asks ChatGPT to answer question for all the things he/she doesn't understand ðŸ¤”.

## Run

1. Code an assembly-like program with the instructions described below in a file ending in .asm
2. Run the go command `go run . <filename.asm>`

## How does it work

- There's 8 registers of 8 bits each: `r0` to `r7`
- Values are written in decimal `0` to `255`, or hex from `0x00` to `0xff`
- Commentaries comes after `//` and are ignored at interpretation

## Instruction

| Mnemonic | Example     | Description                                                       |

| **mov**  | `mov r1 r2` | Copy value of r2 and put it into r1                               |
| **out**  | `out r3`    | Print value of r3                                                 |
| **add**  | `add r1 r2` | Add source to destination                                         |

| **neg**  | `neg r4`    | Arithmetic negation                                               |
| **not**  | `not r4`    | Bitwise negation                                                  |
| **and**  | `and r4 r5` | Bitwise AND destination by source                                 |
| **or**   | `or r4 r5`  | Bitwise OR destination by source                                  |
| **xor**  | `xor r4 r5` | Bitwise XOR destination by source                                 |
| **inc**  | `inc r0`    | Increment r0 by 1                                                 |
| **dec**  | `dec r0`    | Decrement r0 by 1                                                 |
| **shl**  | `shl r1 k`  | Left shift destination by k bits                                  |
| **shr**  | `shl r1 k`  | Right shift destination by k bits                                 |
| **jmp**  | `jmp 4`     | Jump to instruction number 4 (line code 5)                        |
| **jz**   | `jz 4`      | jump to instruction number 4 (line code 5) if r0 is equal to zero |
| **jnz**  | `jzn 4`     | jump to instruction number 4 (line code 5) if r0 not zero         |

## Example of code: Fibonacci

```asm
// Fibonacci sequence

mov r0 245 // Used for conditional repetition

mov r1 0x1
mov r2 1
out r1
out r2

add r3 r1 r2
mov r1 r2
mov r2 r3
out r3
inc r0 // Increment r0 by 1
jnz 9 // Jump to line 10 (instruction 9) if r0 != 0
```
